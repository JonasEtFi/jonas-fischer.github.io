          <p>
            Building energy management commonly uses RL controllers, but safety
            constraints are often treated as a single penalty. This work casts
            the problem as multi-objective RL with vector-valued rewards and
            evaluates MORL algorithms on a smart household scenario, showing
            improved Pareto trade-offs between cost and safety.

            Renewable-heavy grids need energy management strategies that can
            cope with uncertainty in weather and price forecasts. Model
            Predictive Control can be optimal with perfect forecasts, but its
            performance drops in practice. RL controllers have shown cost
            advantages, yet struggle to satisfy hard safety constraints such as
            battery charge bounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traditional approaches add safety violations as a penalty term, but
            this fixes the trade-off in advance and makes retuning expensive.
            This project frames the task as true multi-objective RL, separating
            cost and safety objectives and enabling flexible selection of
            operating points without retraining.
